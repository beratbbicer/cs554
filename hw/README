Two parts of the homework are contained in folders data_image_stitching (Part 1) and data_disparity_estimation (Part 2).
Each of these folders contain a 'main.m' file that reproduces our results.

Other matlab files include:
sift_matching: Match points obtained by sift using nearest neighbour distance ratio matching
distance_homography: Calculate the distnace equation we use while computing the residuals on homography fitting, sqrt((x_p - x)^2 + (y_p - y)^2)
get_correspondance: Calculate cartesian coordinate correspondences of the homography
jacobian_homography: Compute Jacobian we swill use during homography calculation equation
fit_homography: Iteratively fit an homography to a set of points
ransac_homography: Apply RANSAC algorithm to find a homography
