Two parts of the homework are contained in folders data_image_stitching (Part 1) and data_disparity_estimation (Part 2).
Each of these folders contain a 'main.m' file that can be used to reproduce the results in the report.

Other matlab files include:
sift_matching: Match points obtained by sift using nearest neighbour distance ratio matching
distance_homography: Calculate the distnace equation we use while computing the residuals on homography fitting, sqrt((x_p - x)^2 + (y_p - y)^2)
get_correspondance: Calculate cartesian coordinate correspondences of the homography
jacobian_homography: Compute Jacobian we swill use during homography calculation equation
fit_homography: Fit a homography using least-squares formulation and Gauss-Newton algorithm
ransac_homography: Apply RANSAC algorithm to find a good homography
rectification: Rectify one image using the computed homography
correlation_matching: Find pixel-to-pixel matchings from an image pair and compute disparity map
